;;; Commentary:
;;; Code:

;; Corfu enhances in-buffer completion by displaying a compact popup with
;; current candidates, positioned either below or above the point. Candidates
;; can be selected by navigating up or down.
(use-package corfu
  :commands (corfu-mode global-corfu-mode)
  :hook ((prog-mode . corfu-mode)
         (shell-mode . corfu-mode)

  ;; Hide commands in M-x which do not apply to the current mode.
  (read-extended-command-predicate #'command-completion-default-include-p)
  ;; Disable Ispell completion function. As an alternative try `cape-dict'.

;; Cape, or Completion At Point Extensions, extends the capabilities of
;; in-buffer completion. It integrates with Corfu or the default completion UI,
;; by providing additional backends through completion-at-point-functions.
(use-package cape

  :init
  ;; Add to the global default value of `completion-at-point-functions' which is
  ;; used by `completion-at-point'.
