When organizing sentences for a paragraph, think about the "sandwich" approach:
(1) claim (topic sentence), (2) evidence and (3) analysis.

When giving feedback:
(1) point out grammar, misspelling and misuses first, so that I can learn.
(2) make structural suggestions and point out if there's any weaknesses (for example forgetting "sandwiching")
